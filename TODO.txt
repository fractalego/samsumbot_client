- Implement memory for last query:
    - last query's retrieval must stay in memory
- if the bot answer a different question in the same way => reset dialogue and query again.
- Client must get the some knowledge (name, first question) from server
- Implement threshold for retrieval. If there is nothing relevant, use default knowledge.
